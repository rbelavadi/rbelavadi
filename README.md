# 👋 Hi, I'm Ranjani Belavadi

🎓 I'm a CS + Business Info Management student at UC Irvine (Class of 2027), with a passion for building technical systems that are product-conscious, user-aware, and scalable.

## 🚀 What I'm Doing Now
- 🤖 **AI Product Intern @ Vectorial AI**  
  Using LangGraph to evaluate agentic outputs via LLM-as-a-judge, and designing a summarization pipeline to turn dense product data into PM-ready emails.

- 💊 **Building a Medical Assistant** (WIP)  
  A personal AI agent for the elderly to help parse prescriptions, explain medicines in plain terms, and track long-term health changes.

- 🕸️ **Web Search Engine Project**  
  Developed a full-stack engine with Boolean & TF-IDF ranking, PageRank, n-gram indexing, and near-duplicate detection. Built a polite custom crawler indexing over 56,000 pages.
